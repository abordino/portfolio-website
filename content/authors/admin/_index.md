I am a first year student of the [Warwick Centre for Doctoral Training in Mathematics and Statistics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/postgrad/research/), starting in October 2022, and I am kindly supported by the Statistics Department studenship. My research interests include Statistical Machine Learning, Nonparametric Statistics and High Dimensional Statistics: in the last year, I have worked on mathematical aspects of Neural Networks, also using Stein's methods, but I am willing to expand my research directions and work on new statistical problems. 

Before joining the CDT programme in Warwick, I obtained a M.Sc. in Stochastics and Data Science at the University of Turin, working under the supervision of [Professor Stefano Favaro](https://www.carloalberto.org/person/stefano-favaro/), and a B.Sc. in Mathematics at the University of Turin, during which I was recipient of the [INdAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istituto_Nazionale_di_Alta_Matematica_Francesco_Severi) scholarship.
