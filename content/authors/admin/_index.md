I am a second year student of the [Warwick Centre for Doctoral Training in Mathematics and Statistics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/postgrad/research/), working under the supervision of [Dr Thomas Berrett](https://thomasberrett.github.io/) on Nonparametric methods for Missing and Heterogeneous Data. My research interests include Nonparametric Statistics and Statistical Learning Theory.

Before joining the CDT programme in Warwick, I obtained a M.Sc. in Stochastics and Data Science at the University of Turin, working under the supervision of [Professor Stefano Favaro](https://www.carloalberto.org/person/stefano-favaro/), and a B.Sc. in Mathematics at the University of Turin, during which I was recipient of the [INdAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istituto_Nazionale_di_Alta_Matematica_Francesco_Severi) scholarship.

Selected awards:
- Google Deepmind travel award for AABI 2024.
- Silver Medal, awarded to the best graduate of the M.Sc. in Stochastics and Data Science at the University of Turin for the a.y. 2021/22.
- INdAM scholarship for Bachelor Degree in Mathematics, granted by Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica (INdAM). Ranked 7th in Italy
