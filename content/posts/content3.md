I'll let John Conway say why this book is so relevant, citing from the preface of the book: " "How to Solve It" is a wonderful book! This I realized when I first read right through it as a student many years ago, but it has taken me a long time to appreciate just how wonderful it is. Why is that? One part of the answer is that the book is unique. In all my years as a student and teacher, I have never seen another that lives up to George Polyaâ€™s title by teaching you how to go about solving problems." 

He continues: "It is one of the most successful mathematics books ever written, having sold over a million copies and been translated into seventeen languages since it first appeared in 1945."
